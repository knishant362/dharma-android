The material world can bring you freedom, but in another sense, it can also entrap you.

When we meet her, she is bursting with new plans and ideas, and the courage to execute them, and you cannot help but be caught in her excitement. Where others see only the impossible, she does not acknowledge these terms - instead choosing to have a fervent belief in her own ability. She has a reputation for being a 'big picture' kind of person, for with her fiery energy, she goes boldly forth into new adventures, though she may easily get bored when the initial excitement fades, or when she is forced to answer to some detail. When you see her in a reading, perhaps you are being advised to borrow some of her energy, have courage and faith, go out and explore. As a messenger, she brings excitement and energy with her.

You can think of him as a caricature of the hero, risking anything in the face of danger. Because of his confident nature, even though he may not have all the details, he may be able to pull off things that others would never dream of. At the same time, he is quite reckless and impatient, unable to tolerate appointments, he wants everything now. His youthful spirit makes obstacles invisible for him, and so he usually makes a mess out for others to clean up. If he does encounter blockages, he usually just continues to charge at them, for he believes that changing course would be showing cowardice. His appearance in a reading can be a call to face your challenges, as well as a little hint that you perhaps should also think things through a bit.",
