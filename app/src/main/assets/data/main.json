Labyrinthos started from her deciding to illustrate her own deck, the Golden Thread Tarot in 2016. She chose to scrap the instructional booklet, and replace it with an app. Because she is hopelessly stubborn and extremely bad at asking for help, she learned to build mobile apps by coding Golden Thread Tarot herself. At that time, she was still working in various companies as a product designer, where she sometimes used her lunch breaks to give readings.</p>\n<p>Despite what it looks like, Labyrinthos is still run by this lone mysterious headmistress. She does all the illustrations for the decks and app, coding the majority of the app, writing all of our content and articles, social media, and customer service. And yes, she is really very tired all time. Phew.</p>\n<p>Her husband Luis occasionally devotes weekends to helping her code the back end of this app, since unlike Tina, he is an actual engineer and not just a designer pretending to be an engineer. Yay! Thanks Luis!</p>\n<p>The two of them live with their cat Mephisto and their plants in Queens, New York.</p>\n<p>We have never gotten any outside investment, and don't plan on it.   We're a proud mom and pop (and cat) shop! Keeping the app running isn't easy or free though, and we have to pay for data storage, upkeep and more that comes out of our household budget. If you enjoy this app, please consider supporting us by buying one of Tina's printed tarot decks or purchasing some Catssandra credits!</p>\n<p>We hope you enjoy working with the tarot as much as we do.</p>"

When things in life are fleeting and ever-changing, whether the situations are positive and negative, we can learn to not take them too seriously.

This card can also imply distance to its surrounding cards, sometimes concerning long-distance relationships, far away family, or an overseas business trip - depending on your question and the other cards in the spread. This definition too, can also be more metaphorical in nature. While you may be in close proximity physically to something, you may not feel close to it.

This same sense of belonging and comfort, while creating stability and security - can also make it difficult to go forth and try new ways of doing things. The house is a boundary between what is outside and what is inside - it is a bubble or a barrier, something which separates. It implies that there is an “us” and a “them”.

Some of these desires can be harmless, and others, when uncontrolled, can lead to a kind of addiction. There is also the sense that the kind of desire that is represented by the snake is so strong, that incredible determination comes alongside it - sometimes making for an almost single-minded focus. Another facet of the snake can involve deception - to be specific, the kind of deception that is calculating and self serving, almost manipulative.  Another interpretation of the Snake card in Lenormand that is rarely used, but just as important, is its wisdom and knowledge. While in more traditional interpretations, such as the ones above, it has been plastered with morality, there is a more pure reading of the snake that has none of those value judgements. In other cultures, their intelligence is revered, and sacred, and even in western interpretations, we must remember that it was the snake that brought us truth - though, forbidden truth. ",

On a more symbolic level, the Scythe represents harvesting - a time when we are reaping the rewards (or punishments) of our past actions. It can mean a moment of taking stock of what we have accomplished, of self-judgement and reckoning. We must look backward to understand what we can best do to move forward and learn from what has been completed. Therefore, the Scythe can also signal a closure in that sense.",

Usually, this card will indicate some kind of verbal disagreement - when two different modes of thinking collide.

In rare instances, the Whip Lenormand card can also stand for abuse of a physical kind too. The Whip Lenormand card can also stand for any kind of destructive behavior that is fueled by negativity - sometimes the card exists to show that the motivations behind actions are to simply cause another person pain. This card can be a stand in for the suffering that we receive from others. Taking it a step further, when one undergoes the suffering for so long, we can internalize the messages of the Whip card - it can become a form of self-punishment. We can carry with us deep feelings of shame and guilt, that leads us to a cycle of self-hatred.",

Sometimes, this migration can be literal - you may be going through a geographical relocation. But more often, it can be a figurative movement - where you are going through a process where you are redefining certain aspects of yourself. Usually, this is something that starts from within; like the a change in the way you define love, or your own identity. This tends to shape the actions you take and how you make choices. The inward change radiates outward, and it is most times, a very slow process. To understand where in life you’re changing, you’ll have to take a look at the surrounding cards.

There is a sense of impenetrability to these institutions, a feeling that they are quite removed from the average person, and it’s inner workings are hidden and mysterious.

			"description": "Wealth is what is referenced when seeing the Fish in a Lenormand reading. This can be in the standard traditional sense of material goods - concerning finances and business, or it can be in a simpler sense of having many of something, or understanding the value of something. Thus, when looking at the cards, it can simply mean the cards are speaking about something in the financial realm, or the card can really help us examine what it is that is valuable to us. Some things are worthless on paper, but emotionally valuable - a principle, a feeling, an object or something you do. The Fish card also asks us to think about what abundance really means - whether it is the quantity of something or another trait. A negative trait about this card is that it tends to focus on numbers rather than other qualities that we might find more compelling.",

Despite whatever setbacks or tricky situations you find yourself in, you remain steadfast in your choices. Something is giving you the strength and the stability to keep you focused on your desires in the changing winds. The solid focus that the anchor imparts can either be positive or negative - on one hand it creates an environment of safety, but it can also mean that you can become so inflexible that you cannot let go of ideas, concepts or goals that are not really serving you. Whether the anchor in your Lenormand reading becomes a positive or negative force is something that is up to you, and how you choose to use it in the context of your life.",

			"description": "While the Cross can be representative of organized religion, this Lenormand card’s meaning can also be expanded to include the concepts of ideology and responsibility - such as when we come across the phrase “one’s cross to bear”. Ideologies direct our goals, our actions and our values - they create a division between what is “good” and what is “bad”. They tell us what we should do and what we should not do, and can become incredibly harmful when taken to extremes. It is through ideologies that we learn to judge others, and judge ourselves - sometimes going too far and creating a culture of intolerance. Because ideologies have value judgements, they become closely tied with this Lenormand card’s other meanings. Sometimes what is considered the “right” thing to do can drive us towards great accomplishments and fulfillment, but it can also, especially in cases where those ideals and principles are far too extreme, become a heavy burden. We cannot be perfect creatures all the time, we are only human.",

Despite the element of earth within her, she can be rather impractical, but also talented in manifesting her emotions and channeling them into artistic endeavors.

The combination of his elements can mean that he has a talent for philosophy as well as the arts. Scorpio gives him a tendency to bury and protect his greatest passions.

His moods are fickle, he can be easily excited, but also easily bored. His contradictions mean that his attempts at taking action are hasty, and can mean mistakes that lead him to trouble.

The beast is not just satiated, it is ready to retch. Our senses are dulled, what was once an addiction is no longer appealing after we have indulged so much.

It is only as we go through adolescence and then adulthood where we learn about others, about what it means to be empathetic and respectful of those that we meet and the world in which we live. So too, we also learn what we `should` be doing - about what is `right` to do, about what makes someone a `productive`, or `good` in our respective cultural views. We learn to distinguish and give value judgments to our actions and different aspects of ourselves. Somewhere, both between and encompassing our pure innocence and acknowledgment of the other, is our true self, and the place that we spend the totality of our mortal lives trying to reach. Who are we, and where do we come from? Those eternal, nagging questions that never quite receive an answer, are encompassed by this card.",

They are the different parts of your psyche. For example, your feelings (moon) versus your intellect (mercury).\n<br>\n<strong>Houses</strong> are twelve divisions of an astrological chart that correspond to different areas of life. \n<br>\n<strong>Zodiac signs</strong> are twelve distinct archetypes in astrology. \n<br>\n<strong>Moon phases</strong> refer to the changing appearance of the Moon as it cycles through its eight distinct stages, influencing emotions and intentions.  \n<br><br>\nThe 10 planets can be thought to answer either the who (which aspect of myself is activated) or the what (what type of energy is expressed), while the zodiac signs answer how (how the energy is expressed) and the houses represent where (where the energy is expressed).\n<br><br>\nFor astrology decks, we recommend you split each deck into these 4 piles. Draw a single card from each pile for a reading. The combination creates the answer. If you are familiar with tarot cards, the format is similar to having 4 separate mini-decks, where you draw one card from each to answer:\n<br><br>\n1. Zodiac: How am I approaching the situation?<br>\n2. Planet: What part of my personality is involved here?<br>\n3. House: Where in my life does this affect?<br>\n4.

Tarot allows us to put them together in various configurations so that we can see parallels between the stories within the cards and our own experiences.<br><br>\nThe story you tell about yourself greatly influences the way you think about your future. Tarot is about helping you tell your story, finding facets you might have missed.<br><br>\nObviously, this has limits, because <i>we</i> have limits.
